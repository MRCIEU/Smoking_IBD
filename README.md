# Smoking_IBD
The following scripts are for analysing the association between smoking and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as in Jones, Richardson, Gunnell, Davey-Smith, Munafo & Wootton, Exploring the effects of cigarette smoking on inflammatory bowel disease using Mendelian randomisation (MR).

The scripts detail three separate analyses:

1. An observational analysis of UK Biobank data to investigate associations between tobacco smoking and IBD
2. A individual MR analysis investigating the association between a single SNP proxying smoking heaviness and IBD
3. A two-sample, summary level MR analysis of smoking and IBD

The scripts should be run in the following order...

1. Observational analysis
* Observational Analysis.R

2. Individual MR analysis:
* Individual MR Analysis.R

3. Summary level MR analysis:
